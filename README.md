# NQueenProblem-
NQueenProblem is about placing n Queens in nxn sized boards so that no two queens attack each other. 
It's a typical example of backtracking problem.

## NQueen2.cpp
It uses bitset efficiently to output the total number of possible arrangement for a given board. 

# Ones Island
Island is the contiguous occurrences of same symbol over a region. Here in this case the symbol is numeric digit '1'. 
The Floodfill algorithm using DFS can be used to perform the program in very simple and easy at the same time. 
# can Jump
problem description: 
  Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
# Tree from LinkedList
Given a Linked List Representation of Complete Binary Tree. The task is to construct the Binary tree.
Note : The complete binary tree is represented as a linked list in a way where if root node is stored at position i, its left, and right children are stored at position 2*i+1, 2*i+2 respectively.
